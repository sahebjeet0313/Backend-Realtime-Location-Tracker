# Backend-Realtime-Location-Tracker
A backend project that tracks the realtime location of multiple users 

# Real-Time User Tracking System

## Overview
This project is a backend system designed to track users in real-time using **Node.js** and **Socket.IO**. The system can monitor user locations and update the server with each movement, providing a live tracking feature.

## Features
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Instantly track user movements and update their location on the server.
- **Socket.IO Integration:** Leverages WebSockets through Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built with Node.js, allowing for easy scaling and handling of multiple concurrent connections.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for the backend server.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time web applications, enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahebjeet0313/Backend-Realtime-Location-Tracker.git
